# Galactic skills

This is a space for depositing various helpful artifacts (skills, commands, etc.) for various agentic things like Claude Code or Gemini Code Agent. 
The idea is that by iterating over this we will create a robust set of community curated "skills" that would ultimately create guardrails preventing LLMs from doing crazy :shit: and ensuring best practices.
