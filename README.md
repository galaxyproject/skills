# Galactic skills

This is a space for depositing various helpful artifacts ([skills](https://claude.com/blog/skills), [commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#personal-commands), etc.) for various agentic things like Claude Code or Gemini Code Agent. 
The idea is that by iterating over this we will create a robust set of community curated "skills" that would ultimately create guardrails preventing LLMs from doing crazy :shit: and ensuring best practices. Should probably be called Intergalactic LLM-taming commision (ILT).
