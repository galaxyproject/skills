# Agent Instructions (galaxyproject/skills)

When working in this repository, treat the contents of `skills/` as the canonical source of “skills” and follow them as process guidance.

## Nextflow → Galaxy conversions

If the user asks to convert Nextflow pipelines/modules/processes to Galaxy tools/workflows, use the nf-to-galaxy skill family:

- Router:
  - `nf-to-galaxy/SKILL.md`

- Sub-skills:
  - `nf-to-galaxy/nf-process-to-galaxy-tool/SKILL.md`
  - `nf-to-galaxy/nf-subworkflow-to-galaxy-workflow/SKILL.md`
  - `nf-to-galaxy/nf-pipeline-to-galaxy-workflow/SKILL.md`

- Shared references:
  - `nf-to-galaxy/check-tool-availability.md`
  - `nf-to-galaxy/scripts/check_tool.sh`
  - `nf-to-galaxy/testing-and-validation.md` (routing page)
  - `tool-dev/shared/testing.md` (Planemo tool testing)
  - `tool-dev/creation/tool-placement.md` (where to create tools)
  - `galaxy-integration/galaxy-integration.md` (workflow testing on Galaxy instance)
  - `galaxy-integration/examples/` (tool checking and workflow testing examples)

Follow the planning/approval checkpoints required by the skills before implementing changes.

## Galaxy Integration

If the user asks about Galaxy MCP, JupyterLite notebooks, or BioBlend automation:

- Router:
  - `galaxy-integration/SKILL.md`

- Sub-skills:
  - `galaxy-integration/jupyterlite/SKILL.md` (JupyterLite notebooks with gxy package)
  - `galaxy-integration/mcp-reference/SKILL.md` (Galaxy MCP tools reference)

- References:
  - `galaxy-integration/mcp-reference/history-access.md` (history/dataset access patterns)
  - `galaxy-integration/mcp-reference/gotchas.md` (common pitfalls)
  - `galaxy-integration/galaxy-integration.md` (detailed MCP + BioBlend docs)
  - `galaxy-integration/scripts/galaxy_tool_checker.py` (BioBlend automation)
  - `galaxy-integration/examples/` (tool checking and workflow testing examples)
  - `galaxy-integration/jupyterlite/examples/` (JupyterLite notebook examples)

## Other skills in this repo

If the user asks about one of these tasks, use the corresponding skill:

- `hub-news-posts/SKILL.md` (Galaxy Hub news posts)
- `tool-dev/SKILL.md` (Galaxy tool development - router to creation/ or updates/)
